	For loops in python
</h1>

<h2>
	In software developement, <i>for</i> loops are used in controling the flow of the program.
	The purpose of <i>for</i> loops is to iterate through an
	<i>"Iterables"</i> data structure or to iteratively process some data.
	An example of these data structures are Lists, Arrays, Dicts to name a few. <br>
	
	Initially, we will look at incrementing an integer variable with a <i>for</i> loop.<br>

	Considering the above snippet, we can see that we can increment a number using the for loop. 
	
	For a <i>for</i> loop used with an iterable data structure, we can simply use the <i>in</i>
	key word. This will access the data contained within the data structure iteratively. Showing
	with a simple example below:<br>

	In this example, we use the <i>in</i> key word to access the data contained within a list incrementally. 
	It can be seen from this example that the contents of a list need not be homogenic - The contents can changed 
	from integer to string to float etc. This is not within the scope of these notes but it is good to make 
	note that this fluid change of data type is possible within Python data structures - unlike most other programming 
	langauges such as C,C++ or Java. <br>
	
	Finally, there is one other way in which we can access data from a data structure. This is with 
	the <i>enumerate</i> method. The <i>enumerate</i> method works similarly to the <i>in</i> key word,
	however, <i>enumerate</i> also returns both the index of the data item along with its index in the data structure.<br>
